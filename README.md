# Kitchensink HTML5 Mobile Functional Test
This project contains the functional tests for the [Kitchensink HTML5 Mobile Demo](https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-quickstart/tree/master/kitchensink-html5-mobile) project on Android OS. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how to automate the testing of a mobile web application which is deployed on OpenShift(https://www.openshift.com/), on Android OS using [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/) testing platform and [Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/).

The [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/) testing platform is used to enable the testing automation. Arquillian integrates transparently with the testing framework which is JUnit in this case.

You can find a relevant video which shows the testing procedure in action [here](http://vimeo.com/65100903).

## Functional Test Content

The configuration resides in the [Arquillian XML](https://github.com/tolis-e/mobile-web-applications-jenkins-android-openshift/blob/master/src/test/resources/arquillian.xml) configuration file.

[Arquillian XML](https://github.com/tolis-e/mobile-web-applications-jenkins-android-openshift/blob/master/src/test/resources/arquillian.xml) is configured to recognize the Android Emulator using some variables which are placed into the build environment from the Jenkins [Android Emulator Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin).

The mobile web application is already deployed on OpenShift(https://www.openshift.com/) and can be found here(https://kitchensinkhtml5-aemmanou.rhcloud.com/). 

## How it works - Important Notes
The functional test used to test our mobile web application is using the [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/) testing platform. The whole concept is based on a remote Web Driver approach. Each WebDriver command makes a RESTful HTTP request to an Android HTTP server using JSON. The remote server delegates the request to Android WebDriver and returns a response. The Android Server APK path is configured inside the [Arquillian XML](https://github.com/tolis-e/mobile-web-applications-jenkins-android-openshift/blob/master/src/test/resources/arquillian.xml) configuration file. 

The [Jenkins Android Emulator](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin) plugin manages the emulator's lifecycle. The plugin is using the [Port Allocator](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Port+Allocator+Plugin) plugin in order to create random ports so there isn't any need to manage or set the ADB ports manually. In addition it exposes some environment variables during the build procedure. One of these variables is the ANDROID_SERIAL environment variable which represents the AVD Serial Id and uniquely identifies each emulator. The ANDROID_SERIAL environment variable value is propagated to Arquillian and the corresponding configuration resides inside the [Arquillian XML](https://github.com/tolis-e/continuous-integration-of-mobile-web-applications-on-android/blob/master/src/test/resources/arquillian.xml) configuration file.

In case you have build slaves which are headless (e.g. servers without a graphical user interface), you can still run an Android Emulator even although, by default, the emulator does require a graphical environment. You have to untick the "Show emulator window" configuration option in your job configuration.  This is the equivalent of using the emulator's "-no-window" command-line option.

This example has been tested using:

* JBoss EAP 6.0
* Git (used vesrion 1.8.1.4)
* Jenkins CI (used version 1.512)
* Android SDK
* Maven (used Maven 3)
* JDK (used Open JDK 1.7.0)

## Steps to automate the procedure on [Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/)

Clone the current repository and rename it to kitchensink-html5-mobile-test (it is not necessary to rename it - just the below instructions are based on that naming).

Open a Web Browser and navigate to the Jenkins initial page.

Now you should see the Jenkin's first page:

![Jenkins First Page](https://raw.github.com/tolis-e/jenkins-mobile-web-app-android-img/master/jenkins_1.png)

Navigate to Manage Jenkins â†’ Configure System:

![Jenkins Configure System](https://raw.github.com/tolis-e/jenkins-mobile-web-app-android-img/master/jenkins_2.png)

Setup the JDK and Maven:

![Jenkins Setup JDK and Maven](https://raw.github.com/tolis-e/jenkins-mobile-web-app-android-img/master/jenkins_3.png)

Setup Git and Android SDK:

![Jenkins Setup Git and Android SDK](https://raw.github.com/tolis-e/jenkins-mobile-web-app-android-img/master/jenkins_4.png)

Download and install the Jenkins Android Emulator plugin and the Git Plugin:

![Jenkins install the Jenkins Android Emulator plugin and the Git Plugin](https://raw.github.com/tolis-e/jenkins-mobile-web-app-android-img/master/jenkins_5.png)

![Jenkins install the Jenkins Android Emulator plugin and the Git Plugin](https://raw.github.com/tolis-e/jenkins-mobile-web-app-android-img/master/jenkins_6.png)

Now you should see this page on the screen:

![Jenkins plugins downloaded](https://raw.github.com/tolis-e/jenkins-mobile-web-app-android-img/master/jenkins_7.png)

Restart Jenkins so that the changes are applied.

Create a new job on Jenkins. This job executes our functional test using a selected AVD. As mentioned above the AVD lifecycle is managed through the Jenkins Android Emulator plugin.

Setup the repository URL:

![Jenkins setup repository URL](https://raw.github.com/tolis-e/jenkins-mobile-web-app-android-img/master/jenkins_16.png)

Setup the Build Triggers, Build configuration. For convenience I have configured the SCM poll to be every minute but this is something that you can adjust according your desire. You can also tick the Build after other projects are built option and select the job which creates the WAR file.

![Jenkins setup build triggers and configuration](https://raw.github.com/tolis-e/jenkins-mobile-web-app-android-img/master/jenkins_17.png)

Setup the emulator options. You can either select an existing emulator or configure a new one. In case you have build slaves which are headless (e.g. servers without a graphical user interface), you can still run an Android Emulator even although, by default, the emulator does require a graphical environment. You have to untick the "Show emulator window" configuration option in your job configuration. Obviously when executing the test on a headless build machine, it is executed much faster.

Save the job's configuration and execute by clicking Build Now.

## Development approach/methodologies
The development approach is driven from the desire to decouple the testing algorithmic steps / scenarios from the implementation which is tied to a specific DOM structure. For that reason the Page Objects and Page Fragments patterns are used. The Page Objects pattern is used to encapsulate the tested page's structure into one class which contains all the page's parts together with all methods which you will find useful while testing it. The Page Fragments pattern encapsulates parts of the tested page into reusable pieces across all your tests.

## Functional Test Execution
The purpose of the project is to depict how to automate the testing of mobile web applications deployed on OpenShift(https://www.openshift.com/), on Android OS using [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/) testing platform and [Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/). However, it is feasible to execute the functional test as a standalone test (without using Jenkins and the Android Emulator Plugin) after performing some modifications. More specifically, in a such case you have to configure the [Arquillian XML](https://github.com/tolis-e/continuous-integration-of-mobile-web-applications-on-android/blob/master/src/test/resources/arquillian.xml) accordingly so that an Android Emulator starts automatically (avdName, apiLevel, abi properties).

The execution of the functional test as a standalone test is done through maven:

    mvn test
